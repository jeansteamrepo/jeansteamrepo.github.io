You've got the technical theory down, you're the master of "Hello World", you might even have lots of experience in the "tech world". What you dont have is practical experience in your current role. All your peers are masters at their craft, and even some clients seem to know more than you do and one of those client just asked for your input on an issue they are having. Oh no, they are going to find out you dont belong here. 

Relax, take a deep breath and take a comfort in the fact most people will experience Imposter Syndrome at some point in their lives. Do your peers know more about your role than you do? probably, but its also probable that they have been exactly where you are now. And one day, you will probably person that makes the new guy question their place in the organization...
